## 🧠 How NoRugz Uses ZerePy  

NoRugz is built on **ZerePy**, an advanced AI agent framework. We've reengineered ZerePy to align with the **ReAct framework** (Reasoning + Acting), enhancing its ability to make context-aware decisions for token-related tasks.

### 🔹 Key Enhancements to ZerePy  

#### **1️⃣ ReAct-Based Agent Loop**  
Traditional agent loops rely on random actions. We’ve redesigned ZerePy to:  
✅ Suggest a structured list of actions for each problem.  
✅ Analyze the scenario and determine the optimal sequence of actions.  

For example:  
- **Promotional Post Creation**: The agent fetches token data via APIs, interacts with X endpoints, and autonomously generates compelling tweets.  
- **Token Deployment**: The agent analyzes tagged tweets, extracts parameters, and formats them into a structured output for deployment via a smart contract.  

#### **2️⃣ Extending Functionality Across Platforms**  
Beyond X, our agents are equipped to perform similar operations on **Discord**, ensuring flexibility and cross-platform compatibility.  

#### **3️⃣ Enhanced LLM Prompting**  
We’ve reimplemented ZerePy’s LLM prompting to:  
- Adhere to **OpenAI's chat completion and structured output generation standards**.  
- Ensure compatibility with a wide range of LLMs, enabling future experimentation with different models.
