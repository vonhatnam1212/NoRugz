## How NoRugz Uses ZerePy

NoRugz is built on **ZerePy**, an advanced AI agent framework. We've reengineered ZerePy to align with the **ReAct framework** (Reasoning + Acting), enhancing its ability to make context-aware decisions for token-related tasks. Here's how ZerePy powers NoRugz:

### Key Enhancements to ZerePy
1. **ReAct-Based Agent Loop**  
   Traditional agent loops rely on random actions. We’ve redesigned ZerePy to:
   - Suggest a structured list of actions for each problem.
   - Analyze the scenario and determine the optimal sequence of actions.  

   For example:
   - **Promotional Post Creation**: The agent fetches token data via APIs, interacts with X endpoints, and autonomously generates compelling tweets.  
   - **Token Deployment**: The agent analyzes tagged tweets, extracts parameters, and formats them into a structured output for deployment via a smart contract.

2. **Extending Functionality Across Platforms**  
   Beyond X, our agents are equipped to perform similar operations on Discord, ensuring flexibility and cross-platform compatibility.

3. **Enhanced LLM Prompting**  
   We’ve reimplemented ZerePy’s LLM prompting to:
   - Adhere to OpenAI's chat completion and structured output generation standards.
   - Ensure compatibility with a wide range of LLMs, enabling future experimentation with different models.
