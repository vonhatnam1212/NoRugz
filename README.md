# NoRugz: AI-Powered Memecoin Launch & Shill Platform

Welcome to **NoRugz**, the cutting-edge AI platform designed to revolutionize memecoin creation and promotion. Our platform seamlessly integrates with **X (formerly Twitter) and Discord** to empower users with advanced AI-driven tools for **token deployment and marketing**.

## üöÄ What You Can Do on NoRugz

### On X (Twitter)
- **Launch Tokens via Tweets**  
  Tag our LLM in your tweet, and it will deploy a token based on the parameters derived from your message.
- **Create Promotional Posts**  
  Our LLM can generate engaging, attention-grabbing promotion posts for your tokens to ensure maximum visibility.

### On Discord
- **Launch Tokens via Mentions**  
  Mention our LLM in a Discord chat, and it will handle the token deployment process based on your instructions.
- **Anti-Rug Check**  
  Users can mention our bot with a token contract address to analyze its security, detecting potential **rug pull risks** before investing.

## üß† How NoRugz Uses ZerePy  

NoRugz is built on **ZerePy**, an advanced AI agent framework. We've reengineered ZerePy to align with the **ReAct framework** (Reasoning + Acting), enhancing its ability to make context-aware decisions for token-related tasks.

### üîπ Key Enhancements to ZerePy  

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ ReAct-Based Agent Loop**  
Traditional agent loops rely on random actions. We‚Äôve redesigned ZerePy to:  
‚úÖ Suggest a structured list of actions for each problem.  
‚úÖ Analyze the scenario and determine the optimal sequence of actions.  

For example:  
- **Promotional Post Creation**: The agent fetches token data via APIs, interacts with X endpoints, and autonomously generates compelling tweets.  
- **Token Deployment**: The agent analyzes tagged tweets, extracts parameters, and formats them into a structured output for deployment via a smart contract.  

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Extending Functionality Across Platforms**  
Beyond X, our agents are equipped to perform similar operations on **Discord**, ensuring flexibility and cross-platform compatibility.  

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Enhanced LLM Prompting**  
We‚Äôve reimplemented ZerePy‚Äôs LLM prompting to:  
- Adhere to **OpenAI's chat completion and structured output generation standards**.  
- Ensure compatibility with a wide range of LLMs, enabling future experimentation with different models.  

## Anti-Rug Protection: AI-Powered Security for Safer Investments  

At **NoRugz**, we leverage a combination of **Machine Learning (ML) models** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to analyze smart contracts and detect potential rug-pull risks in real time. Our dual-layer security approach ensures a safer memecoin ecosystem by providing:  

- **Smart Contract Risk Analysis** ‚Äì Our ML models scan contract bytecode and transaction history, identifying suspicious patterns such as hidden minting functions, high tax fees, ownership renouncement status, and potential honeypots.  
- **LLM-Based Code Review** ‚Äì Our AI agent, powered by state-of-the-art LLMs, performs an in-depth semantic analysis of Solidity contracts, identifying deceptive practices like proxy contract exploits, unrestricted privilege functions, and backdoor vulnerabilities.  
- **On-Chain & Off-Chain Behavior Analysis** ‚Äì We aggregate and analyze blockchain activity alongside social sentiment to detect anomalies, such as sudden liquidity withdrawals, token dumps by insiders, or misleading promotional strategies.  

By combining **ML‚Äôs pattern recognition** with **LLM‚Äôs contextual understanding**, NoRugz delivers **accurate, real-time insights** into token security, empowering users to make **informed** investment decisions.  

Just mention our bot on **Discord** with a token contract address, and our AI will handle the rest! üöÄ

# üõ†Ô∏è How to Run NoRugz

NoRugz consists of a Next.js frontend and a ZerePy backend (Python). Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vonhatnam1212/NoRugz.git
cd NoRugz
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up the Backend (ZerePy)

### Install Dependencies

```sh
cd ZerePy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install poetry
poetry install --no-root
```

### Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory using the provided `.env.sample` file:

```sh
cp .env.sample .env
```

Edit `.env` with your actual API keys and configuration:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
TWITTER_API_KEY=your_twitter_api_key
TWITTER_API_SECRET=your_twitter_api_secret
```

### Start the Backend Server

```sh
python main.py
```

# CLI Commands Help
