NoRugz: AI-Powered Memecoin Launch & Shill Platform

Welcome to NoRugz, the cutting-edge AI platform designed to revolutionize memecoin creation and promotion. Our platform seamlessly integrates with X (formerly Twitter) and Discord to empower users with advanced AI-driven tools for token deployment and marketing.

What You Can Do on NoRugz
On X
Launch Tokens via Tweets Tag our LLM in your tweet, and it will deploy a token based on the parameters derived from your message.
Create Promotional Posts Our LLM can generate engaging, attention-grabbing promotional posts for your tokens to ensure maximum visibility.
On Discord
Launch Tokens via Mentions Mention our LLM in a Discord chat, and it will handle the token deployment process based on your instructions.
Anti-Rug Check Users can mention the bot in Discord with a token contract address, and our AI will analyze the smart contract to detect potential rug-pull risks. This ensures a safer memecoin ecosystem for everyone.
How NoRugz Uses ZerePy
NoRugz is built on ZerePy, an advanced AI agent framework. We've reengineered ZerePy to align with the ReAct framework (Reasoning + Acting), enhancing its ability to make context-aware decisions for token-related tasks. Here's how ZerePy powers NoRugz:

Key Enhancements to ZerePy
ReAct-Based Agent Loop Traditional agent loops rely on random actions. We’ve redesigned ZerePy to:
Suggest a structured list of actions for each problem.
Analyze the scenario and determine the optimal sequence of actions.
Example: For promotional post creation, the agent fetches token data via APIs, interacts with X endpoints, and autonomously generates compelling tweets.
For token deployment, the agent analyzes tagged tweets, extracts parameters, and formats them into a structured output for deployment via a smart contract.
Extending Functionality Across Platforms Beyond X, our agents are equipped to perform similar operations on Discord, ensuring flexibility and cross-platform compatibility.
Enhanced LLM Prompting We’ve reimplemented ZerePy’s LLM prompting to:
Adhere to OpenAI's chat completion and structured output generation standards.
Ensure compatibility with a wide range of LLMs, enabling future experimentation with different models.
